# DESCRIPTION

In Task 4, we applied linear programming using the PuLP library to solve a real-world business optimization problem. The goal was to determine the optimal number of products A and B to maximize profit within the limits of labor and material. The model was solved using PuLPâ€™s built-in solver, and the output helped derive actionable production decisions. This task demonstrates how mathematical modeling in Python can enhance decision-making in operational and manufacturing environments.
